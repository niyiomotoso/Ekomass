00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:17,946
I think Amira's gonna do something.

4
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,883
He thinks you're planning
an attack at the school

5
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:21,601
with someone. He doesn't
know it's with me.

6
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:23,619
AMIRA: <i>I told him I've
explained everything to you</i>

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:24,953
and you believed it.

8
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:25,954
Did Drew believe it?

9
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:27,122
I knew you were lying to me.

10
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,691
He was the one you were texting?!

11
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:29,892
[grunting]

12
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,284
I was beginning to think this
was gonna happen without you.

13
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:39,635
REBECCA: <i>The party asked
John to run four years ago.</i>

14
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:41,270
<i>He knew I couldn't track Bin-Khalid</i>

15
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,105
<i>and work on his campaign
at the same time.</i>

16
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:44,740
Standing up for the
truth the way you did...

17
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,742
It's what I've been telling
the American people I'm gonna

18
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:48,210
do for them.

19
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,344
NILAA: <i>You'll still take a hit.</i>

20
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:50,779
Well, the hit I can take.

21
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,981
It's the not swinging back...
That's what bothers me.

22
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:54,983
There's a hit on whoever accessed

23
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,018
the Army Rangers' identities.

24
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,759
The computer that belongs to

25
00:00:57,762 --> 00:00:58,995
Nilaa Mizrani.

26
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,090
My husband's campaign manager.

27
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,292
Isaac, we can't let him do this.

28
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,727
I want to talk to him.

29
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:06,562
ISAAC: <i>To try to change his mind? Nah.</i>

30
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:08,797
He gonna do what he gonna do.
You know the man you married.

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,733
- You are unbelievable.
- She's my brother's wife.

32
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:12,510
Like that would stop you
starting up with her again.

33
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,569
Don't get crazy.

34
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:15,003
Money ain't coming in like it was.

35
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,472
That's why I reached out to you

36
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:18,807
in the first place,
put this deal together.

37
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:21,143
If Isaac doesn't make it
back from this meeting,

38
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,678
<i>wouldn't be a lot of tears.</i>

39
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:27,058
Bin-Khalid's people... They found us.

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,027
<i>They killed the rest of the squad.</i>

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,254
<i>There was a flash drive</i>

42
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,857
<i>containing a list of sleeper cells,</i>

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,965
along with all the codes
to trigger their attacks.

44
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,534
- Are you saying Grimes still has it?
- He said he'll sell it

45
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:38,637
to the terrorists if we
don't give him want he wants.

46
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,105
Two million dollars.

47
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,474
<i>Show up at the 7th Street
metro station in one hour.</i>

48
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,009
You got to give me more time!

49
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,510
You get me the money, or
I call Bin-Khalid's men.

50
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:46,945
I took one of their phones.

51
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:49,547
Just tell me if the money's
at the police station, Rebecca.

52
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,049
Your source is right.

53
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,451
Metro PD made a drug
bust in Southeast D.C.

54
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:55,854
Recovered a little over
$4.6 million in cash.

55
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,323
CARTER: <i>Just need to know
where the evidence lockers are.</i>

56
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:00,926
REBECCA: <i>This is crazy. You'll
never get out of there alive.</i>

57
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,560
ANDY: <i>Okay, feeding in the loops.</i>

58
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:03,361
Go.

59
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,966
- We were pulled off-line.
- They know.

60
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,296
Keith, we're running an
operation. If you shut us...

61
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,659
You're not running anything!
Lock them in interrogation now.

62
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,410
Rebecca, can you hear me?!

63
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:20,178
[no audio]

64
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,823
Can anyone hear me?!

65
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,596
_

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,938
_

67
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:33,191
Rebecca respects you.

68
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,126
It's not about not trusting you.

69
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:37,329
She had no choice.

70
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:41,199
Once she confirmed you weren't
the breach, she was relieved.

71
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,235
Can I get some water?

72
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,137
It-it is so hot in
here. Are you not hot?

73
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,676
[sighs]: Oh, God.

74
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:53,478
His story syncs up with Rebecca's.

75
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,347
They could be covering for each other.

76
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,315
According to his autonomic indicators,

77
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:58,883
he's telling the truth.

78
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,488
Perp managed to get his hands on a gun.

79
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,991
He took Vernon and Bates hostage
before they could process him.

80
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:07,158
Who is he?

81
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,393
Name's Eric Carter.

82
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,836
MARX: Mr. Carter!

83
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,768
This is Commander George Marx.
Tell me if you can hear me.

84
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,269
I hear you fine.

85
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,672
But if you want your
men alive, you stay out!

86
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:22,407
MARX: Nobody's doing anything.

87
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,142
Let's just keep talking, okay?

88
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:27,012
Tell me what you want.
I'll see what I can do.

89
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:31,227
Mr. Carter?

90
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,259
What's on the other side of this wall?

91
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,994
It's only a matter of time
before they come busting

92
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,396
through that door.

93
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,463
Shut up.

94
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,740
Listen, whatever you think
you know about me, you don't.

95
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:54,372
My name is Eric Carter.
I'm a former Army Ranger,

96
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:56,341
working with the National
Counter-Terrorism Unit.

97
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:58,710
The guy that was on that phone...

98
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:00,211
He has a list of sleeper cells

99
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,047
that are waiting to be activated.

100
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,948
If I don't get this money to him,

101
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,950
he's gonna sell that
list to the terrorists,

102
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,619
and there will be attacks
all over this country.

103
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,753
Do you understand me?!

104
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:09,854
Yeah, right.

105
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,460
Please.

106
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,595
Please.

107
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,264
I need your help.

108
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,866
Why don't you open that door,
explain it to the captain?

109
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,436
I swear to you, there
is no time for that.

110
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:35,157
Behind that wall...

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,381
Damn it, Bates!

112
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,147
...there's a stairwell. It
leads to a maintenance room

113
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,150
and a door to the back of the building.

114
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,135
Yeah. Send it to HRT.

115
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:00,038
They're on their way over here now.

116
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,073
I went deeper into Carter's file.

117
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,908
Guy enlisted in the Army.

118
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,977
Did tours in Afghanistan and Yemen,

119
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,546
worked his way up to Special Forces.

120
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,881
Special Forces?

121
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:10,982
Yep.

122
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:11,850
[explosion]

123
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:18,123
[panting]

124
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,860
- Get me out of here.
- Yeah.

125
00:05:23,678 --> 00:05:24,944
Bates.

126
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:28,011
- Bates! He's getting away!
- Move!

127
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,333
Get through that door now!

128
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:32,537
He's getting away!

129
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,038
Come on, this way.

130
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,558
Bates! Hurry!

131
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:38,927
Go, go, go!

132
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,947
- Carter's gone. He's got a gun.
- Cut him loose!

133
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,317
- OFFICER: Room clear!
- Go, go, go!

134
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,785
This way. Follow me. On me.

135
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:50,121
DANIELS: Dispatch, this
is Lieutenant Daniels.

136
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:52,190
I'm ordering an emergency lockdown.

137
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,858
An armed suspect, six-two,

138
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,194
African-American, has escaped custody.

139
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,197
He is ex-military, and he is
holding an officer hostage.

140
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,484
Out this way!

141
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:08,540
Is there another way out?

142
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,742
That terrorist thing...
It's for real, right?

143
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,577
Yes. It's real.

144
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,346
[panting] Listen, if I
don't get out of here,

145
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:18,089
a lot of people are gonna die.

146
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,416
There's another exit on the roof.

147
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,418
Move.

148
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,020
Move, move, move.

149
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,788
It's down this way. Oh!

150
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,256
Visual of suspect!

151
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,891
[grunts]

152
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,026
- Come here!
- Oh!

153
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:29,494
Lower your weapons!

154
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:30,562
- Lower your weapons!
- Carter!

155
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,564
- Lower your weapons!
- Carter!

156
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,499
- Lower your weapon!
- You lower your weapons!

157
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,100
Let the man go!

158
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:37,335
I will kill him!

159
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:38,836
- MARX: Carter!
- CARTER: Drop your guns!

160
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,838
- This ends now!
- I need to get out of here!

161
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,873
OFFICER: I have a shot.

162
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,570
- I have to get out of here!
- Stand down.

163
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,990

of hisself.

328
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,723
He is looking out for me.

329
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:09,195
Okay, listen, if... if
you can get her number

330
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,497
and tell me when she made that call,

331
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:13,966
CTU might be able to
pull up a transcript

332
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,501
or some kind of recording, okay?

333
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:16,969
They can do that?

334
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,906
They can do a lot of stuff
I didn't know they could.

335
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,747
Just make sure you tap into

336
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:29,081
all those surveillance cameras, okay?

337
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,116
[car approaching]

338
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,494
It's good to see you again, Carter.

339
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,432
I need a favor.

340
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:45,698
Phone call I need pulled for my wife.

341
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,767
- Those are the details.
- I'll get someone on it for you.

342
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:48,851
This is Agent Locke.

343
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,403
He's the best tactical
specialist in CTU.

344
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:51,685
He'll be leading the field team.

345
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:55,534
Now, we have no way of knowing

346
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,087
how Grimes will approach
you at the station.

347
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,045
We'll keep the bulk of the tac
team out of your line of sight.

348
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,379
Agent Locke will shadow you.

349
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,448
As long as he stays invisible.

350
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,216
Grimes won't see me.

351
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:07,053
We've just hot mic'd your phone.

352
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,554
We'll be able to hear
everything that's going on,

353
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:09,989
and we will not make any moves

354
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:11,390
till we confirm that Grimes
has the list with him.

355
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,660
Yeah, I'm due at the station.

356
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:15,861
Good luck.

357
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,732
Locke.

358
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,037
Look, I don't know what
your orders are, but, um,

359
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,840
I don't want Ben coming
out of this in a body bag.

360
00:16:27,842 --> 00:16:29,675
That's up to him.

361
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:30,876
I'm just after the list.

362
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:32,745
So am I.

363
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:35,982
But Ben and I served together.
That makes us brothers.

364
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,850
No matter what he's done.

365
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:43,055
[engine starts]

366
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,342
You asked me to remotely
erase the memory.

367
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,445
I ran a locate on Malik
and Rashid's phones.

368
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,581
Also their guys, huh?

369
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,400
Five of the phones are here, stationary,

370
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:55,534
in police custody.

371
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:57,737
We lost six men, not five.

372
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,106
The sixth one is in motion.

373
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,041
Someone else has it.

374
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,612
It's either Grimes or Carter.

375
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,083
Whoever has that phone,
I'll get him myself,

376
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:12,948
so there will be no more mistakes.

377
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,943
[steady beeping]

378
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,289
[school bell ringing]

379
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,991
We wait until it's
dark before we move him.

380
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,127
This is bad.

381
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:43,596
We've stayed hidden
for two years, Amira.

382
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,432
And we stay that way as long
as we have to, I promise.

383
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:49,936
How's the teacher holding up?

384
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,504
He's fine.

385
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,607
'Cause killing someone
for the first time, it...

386
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,008
it's no small thing.

387
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,376
And we can't do this without him.

388
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,377
You understand, Amira?

389
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,464
_

390
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,534
You don't sound so sure.

391
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:08,861
_

392
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,825
Your brother was asking
about me, wasn't he?

393
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,528
Yes.

394
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,029
And what did you say?

395
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:20,166
I told him you're with us.

396
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:22,188
So don't make me a liar.

397
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,477
No, I absolutely agree with that, but...

398
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,346
Why don't you grab a bite to eat first.

399
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:35,181
I'll catch up with you outside.

400
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,662
Hmm? Thank you so much, both of you.

401
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,522
Okay, so tell me, what
the hell is going on?

402
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:47,126
John... this is the last thing

403
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,394
I want to be telling you.

404
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,896
The last thing you need to hear.

405
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:54,901
Someone used my proprietary
code to get into the CTU system.

406
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,503
They accessed the file
identifying the Rangers

407
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,105
who took out Bin-Khalid.

408
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,907
And now most of them are dead.

409
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:05,211
We ran a trace.

410
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:08,581
The file was accessed
from Nilaa's computer.

411
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,284
I don't...

412
00:19:11,286 --> 00:19:12,718
Why would she do that?

413
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,287
I'm not sure yet.

414
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:16,522
But the upshot is: she may be
facilitating a terrorist attack

415
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,723
on domestic soil.

416
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:23,095
John.

417
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,701
Gage's campaign came
up with some evidence

418
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,037
linking Nilaa to a radical mosque.

419
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,705
I confronted her about it,

420
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:35,708
and she... she said she
was there to protest,

421
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,411
and I-I believed her.

422
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,714
I understand. You wanted to believe her.

423
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:45,151
She volunteered for
my first Senate race.

424
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:46,886
You know, she went from

425
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,989
working the phone banks
to running my campaign.

426
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:53,059
I'm sorry, John.

AGENT FOX: Excuse me, ma'am.

428
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,930
We're ready.

429
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:02,168
She's in here.

430
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,803
I had them set up video and audio

431
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,271
before they sequestered her.

432
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,574
Your guests are expecting you outside,

433
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,409
you should get back to them.

434
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,346
No. I-I need to see this.

435
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,580
Okay.

436
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,318
[sniffs]

[clears throat]

438
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,364
Do you know why I asked to talk to you?

439
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,965
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

440
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,600
Take a seat.

441
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,335
I'd rather stand.

442
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,139
Over the last few hours,

443
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:43,275
terrorists killed four of the
Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.

444
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:50,516
This is a copy of my server log.

445
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,184
The highlighted subroutine

446
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:54,286
contains the wit-sec
information on those Rangers.

447
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,355
It was accessed 25 days ago

448
00:20:56,357 --> 00:21:00,192
at 6:05 a.m. from your I.P. address.

449
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:03,562
Nilaa, we've known each other

450
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,498
a long time.

451
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,402
I don't want this to be
you, so help me understand.

452
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,504
Who are you working with?

453
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:14,774
First Gage tries linking
me to some radical mosque,

454
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,476
and now you're calling me a terrorist?

455
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:19,245
Well, it wasn't me.

456
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,381
You need to do better than that.

457
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:24,550
I wasn't at campaign headquarters then.

458
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:28,100
I take a run every morning
at 6:00, right after I pray.

459
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:30,170
I never miss either one when I'm in D.C.

460
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:37,229
Show me your route.

461
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,772
We'll see if we can confirm it.

You said I could come
by to go over my test.

465
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,591
She'll go away.

466
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:07,293
Not if she heard the faucet.

Wait!

Hey, Grace, uh, sorry,
I-I completely spaced.

472
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:25,928
I'm working with another,
uh, student right now.

473
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,250
So maybe we can do this tomorrow.

474
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,953
Are you all right, Mr. Harris?

Oh, I'm not, um...

I-I dropped a beaker.

00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,064
It's nothing.

So, I'll see you tomorrow.

[lock clicks]

She could tell that I was lying to her.

- I don't think so.
- We have to get him out of here.

There was a situation at CTU.

But I can't find it.

534
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,370
That's because NSA
hasn't captured it yet

from the phone company servers.

536

into the system directly

and I.D. the cell tower
that handled the call...

Thought if it got out,
it'd screw up his career.

Geez, what year is he living in?

That's what Tom thinks, anyway.
